PHONES SAVED

My phone died right before the headliner at Glastonbury. Wattl literally saved my night. Found a station in seconds, grabbed a bank, and captured the entire finale.

The fast charging is no joke. 15 minutes anxiety around my dead phone vanished. It’s not just a convenience; it’s essential hospitality gear now.

Lost my group, phone dead, panic setting in. The Wattl station was a beacon in the dark. Charged up, found my friends, and turned a disaster into the best night ever.
