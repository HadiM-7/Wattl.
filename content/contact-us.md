### FAQ Accordion Items (dark/black background bars with yellow text, expandable)

1. **How is the rental pricing calculated?**
   - Answer: We charge a simple half-hourly rate of $2. If you hold onto the power bank for a longer period, you will simply reach our daily maximum cap of $20 for that 24-hour period.

2. **What happens if I lose the power bank?**
   - Answer: If the power bank is not returned within 36 hours, the system marks it as "purchased." You will be charged the full device fee of $50, and the power bank is yours to keep.

3. **Can I return the power bank to a different station?**
   - Answer: Yes! You can rent a power bank from one venue and return it to any other station in our network. Use the app to find the nearest available return slot.

4. **What cables are attached?**
   - Answer: Yes! You can rent a power bank from one venue and return it to any other station in our network. Use the app to find the nearest available return slot.
